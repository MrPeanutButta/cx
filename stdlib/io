/** Cx library to perform Input/Output operations
 *
 * @file     : io
 * @author   : <aaron.hebert@gmail.com>
 * @date	 : April 26 2014
 * @desc     : Input/Output operations
 *
 * This library uses what are called streams to operate with physical devices
 * such as keyboards, printers, terminals or with any other type of files
 * supported by the system. Streams are an abstraction to interact with these
 * in an uniform way; All streams have similar properties independently of the
 * individual characteristics of the physical media they are associated with.
 *
 * Streams are handled in the (C++) cstdio library as pointers to FILE objects.
 * A pointer to a FILE object uniquely identifies a stream, and is used as a
 * parameter in the operations involving that stream.
 *
 * There also exist three standard streams: stdin, stdout and
 * stderr, which are automatically created and opened for all programs
 * using the library.

/** @todo
 * @need #define directive to omit including headers twice
 * @need to test wide char functions
 */

/*
 * Defined externally in io.cpp:
 * perror - displays a character string corresponding of the current error to stderr (function)
 * remove - erases a file (function)
 * rename - renames a file (function)
 * tmpnam - returns a unique filename (function)

 * stdin - expression of type FILE* associated with the input stream
 * stdout - expression of type FILE* associated with the output stream
 * stderr - expression of type FILE* associated with the error output stream

 * EOF - integer constant expression of type int and negative value (macro constant)
 * FOPEN_MAX - number of files that can be open simultaneously (macro constant)
 * FILENAME_MAX - size needed for an array of char to hold the longest supported file name (macro constant)
 * SEEK_SET - argument to std::fseek indicating seeking from beginning of the file (macro constant)
 * SEEK_CUR - argument to std::fseek indicating seeking from the current file position (macro constant)
 * SEEK_END - argument to std::fseek indicating seeking from end of the file (macro constant)
 * TMP_MAX - maximum number of unique filenames that can be generated by std::tmpnam (macro constant)
 * L_tmpnam - size needed for an array of char to hold the result of std::tmpnam (macro constant)
